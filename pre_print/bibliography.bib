  abstract = {Eight weeks of isometric training at a long or short muscle-tendon unit length increased and did not change fascicle length, respectively. The ``width'' of the torque-angle relationship plateau became broader following isometric training at the long length. Despite marked differences in muscle architecture and functional adaptations between the groups, there was only a small-magnitude improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance, which was surprisingly negatively related to increased fascicle length in the long length-training group. , We evaluated the effects of differential muscle architectural adaptations on neuromuscular fatigue resistance. Seven young males and six females participated in this study. Using a longitudinal within-subject design, legs were randomly assigned to perform isometric training of the tibialis anterior (TA) three times per week for 8 wk at a short (S-group) or long muscle-tendon unit length (L-group). Before and following training, fascicle length (FL) and pennation angle (PA) of the TA were assessed. As well, fatigue-related time course changes in isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque and isotonic peak power (20\% MVC resistance) were determined before, immediately after, and 1, 2, 5, and 10 min following task failure. The fatiguing task consisted of repeated maximal effort isotonic (20\% MVC resistance) contractions over a 40{$^\circ$} range of motion until the participant reached a 40\% reduction in peak power. Although there was no clear improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance following training in either group ( P = 0.081; S-group: {$\sim$}20\%; L-group: {$\sim$}51\%), the change in neuromuscular fatigue resistance was related positively to the training-induced increase in PA ({$\sim$}6\%, P {$<$} 0.001) in the S-group ( r\,=\,0.739, P = 0.004) and negatively to the training-induced increase in FL ({$\sim$}4\%, P = 0.001) in the L-group ( r\,=\,-0.568, P = 0.043). Both groups recovered similarly for MVC torque and peak power after the fatiguing task as compared with before training. We suggest that the relationships between the changes in muscle architecture and neuromuscular fatigue resistance depend on the muscle-tendon unit lengths at which the training is performed. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Eight weeks of isometric training at a long or short muscle-tendon unit length increased and did not change fascicle length, respectively. The ``width'' of the torque-angle relationship plateau became broader following isometric training at the long length. Despite marked differences in muscle architecture and functional adaptations between the groups, there was only a small-magnitude improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance, which was surprisingly negatively related to increased fascicle length in the long length-training group.},

The sample effect size value can be misleading because it contains sampling error. Authors often incorrectly interpret the sample effect size as if it were the population effect size. A simple solution to this problem is to report a confidence interval for the population value of the effect size. Standardized linear contrasts of means are useful measures of effect size in a wide variety of research applications. New confidence intervals for standardized linear contrasts of means are developed and may be applied to between-subjects designs, within-subjects designs, or mixed designs. The proposed confidence interval methods are easy to compute, do not require equal population variances, and perform better than the currently available methods when the population variances are not equal.

Twenty-two detrained men (23.3{\textpm}4.1 years) were randomly allocated to the following groups: a group that performed the same exercises in all training sessions (N-VAR=11) or one that varied the exercises for the same muscle groups (VAR=11). All were submitted to 3 weekly sessions for nine weeks. Muscle thickness was assessed at the proximal, middle, and distal sites of the lateral and anterior thigh, elbow flexors, and extensors by B-mode ultrasound. The VAR group significantly increased all the sites analyzed (P{$<$}0.05). Furthermore, the proximal site of the lateral thigh showed a larger relative increase when compared to the middle site (P{$<$}0.05). In contrast, the N-VAR group were not revealed significant improvements only for the middle site of the lateral thigh and the proximal site of the elbow flexors (P{$>$}0.05). Our results suggest that to perform different resistance exercises can induce hypertrophy of all sites assessed in detrained young men.},

Based on five examples and a design space analysis, we show how combining those two ideas can complement existing reporting approaches and constitute a step towards more transparent research papers.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether kinetic chain pattern during knee extensor strength training influences quadriceps femoris center of mass and moment of inertia about the hip in a predictable manner as such changes can affect running economy. Methods: Twelve participants completed 8 weeks of both unilateral open (OKC) and closed (CKC) kinetic chain resistance training on opposing legs. Changes in quadriceps femoris muscle volume (VOL QF ), center of mass location (CoM QF ), and moment of inertia ( I QF ) about the hip were determined from magnetic resonance images scans. Regional hemodynamics of the vastus lateralis taken at 30\% and 70\% of muscle length during OKC and CKC bouts early in the training program were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and used post hoc to predict changes in CoM QF . Results: While increases in VOL QF were similar between OKC ({$\Delta$}79.5 {\textpm} 87.9 cm 3 ) and CKC ({$\Delta$}60.2 {\textpm} 110.5 cm 3 , p = 0.29), the patterns of hypertrophy differed; a distal shift in CoM QF ({$\Delta$}2.4 {\textpm} 0.4 cm, p \&lt; 0.001) and increase in I QF ({$\Delta$}0.017 {\textpm} 0.014 kg m 2 , p \&lt; 0.001) occurred in OKC but not in CKC (CoM QF : {$\Delta$}-2.2 {\textpm} 2.0 cm, I QF : {$\Delta$}-0.022 {\textpm} 0.020 kg m 2 , p \&gt; 0.05). Regional hemodynamics assessed by NIRS during a single training session displayed similar exercise and regional differences and predicted 39.6\% of observed changes in CoM QF . Conclusions: Exercise selection influences muscle shape sufficiently to affect CoM QF and I QF , and these changes may be predicted in part from NIRS measurements during a single workout. Given I QF is inversely related to running economy and since CKC exercise provides a more proximal pattern of hypertrophy than OKC, it may be more preferential for running. The results from the present study also highlight the potential of NIRS as a tool for predicting patterns of hypertrophy between different exercises and exercise conditions.}

  abstract = {Bodybuilding is a competitive endeavor where a combination of muscle size, symmetry, "conditioning" (low body fat levels), and stage presentation are judged. Success in bodybuilding requires that competitors achieve their peak physique during the day of competition. To this end, competitors have been reported to employ various peaking interventions during the final days leading to competition. Commonly reported peaking strategies include altering exercise and nutritional regimens, including manipulation of macronutrient, water, and electrolyte intake, as well as consumption of various dietary supplements. The primary goals for these interventions are to maximize muscle glycogen content, minimize subcutaneous water, and reduce the risk abdominal bloating to bring about a more aesthetically pleasing physique. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of evidence to support the commonly reported practices employed by bodybuilders during peak week. Hence, the purpose of this article is to critically review the current literature as to the scientific support for pre-contest peaking protocols most commonly employed by bodybuilders and provide evidence-based recommendations as safe and effective strategies on the topic.},

Hamstrings CSA were acquired with US (by an expert operator) at four different sites of femur length (FL) in 85 youth competitive alpine skiers (14.8\,{\textpm}\,0.5 years), and successively compared to corresponding scans obtained by MRI, analyzed by a trained vs. a novice rater. The agreement between techniques was assessed by Bland--Altman analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient ( r ). US-derived CSA showed a very good agreement compared to MRI-based ones. The best sites were 40\% FL (0\,=\,mid patellar point) for biceps femoris long head (r\,=\,0.9), 50\% for semitendinosus (r\,=\,0.9), and 30\% for semimembranosus (r\,=\,0.86) and biceps femoris short head (BFsh, r\,=\,0.8). US-based vs. MRI-based hamstrings volume showed an r of 0.96. Poorer r values were observed for the novice compared to the trained rater, with the biggest difference observed for BFsh at 50\% (r\,=\,0.001 vs. r\,=\,0.50, respectively) and semimembranosus at 60\% (r\,=\,0.23 vs. r\,=\,0.42, respectively). Panoramic US provides valid CSA values and volume estimations compared to MRI. To ensure optimal US-vs.-MRI agreement, raters should preferably possess previous experience in imaging-based analyses.},

J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1286--1294, 2019---The acute response to and long-term effects of partial range of motion exercise (PRE) and full range of motion exercise (FRE) of elbow extensors were compared in young trained men. The PRE was expected to increase the intramuscular hypoxic environment, which was theorized to enhance muscular hypertrophy. Forty-four resistance-trained men were divided into 2 training groups, PRE ( n = 22) or FRE ( n = 22) group, and performed the PRE or FRE acute exercise protocol. The PRE (elbow range from 45{$^\circ$} to 90{$^\circ$}) and FRE (from 0{$^\circ$} to 120{$^\circ$}) acute protocols consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with an 8RM, and an equivalent workload. After the initial testing, the training program for each group, comprised 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks, was started. The acute responses of area under the oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) curve, blood lactate concentration, and root mean square of electromyography were significantly higher both before and after PRE than FRE training. Long-term effects were produced by both PRE and FRE, with significant ( p {$\leq$} 0.05) increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of triceps brachii and isometric strength. The CSA increased significantly greater after PRE (48.7 {\textpm} 14.5\%) than after FRE (28.2 {\textpm} 10.9\%). Furthermore, during the PRE program, a positive correlation was detected between the percent increase in CSA and area under the Oxy-Hb curves before and after 8-week exercise training (before 8-week exercise training: r = 0.59, after 8-week exercise training: r = 0.70, p {$<$} 0.01). These results suggest that intramuscular hypoxia might facilitate muscular hypertrophy with PRE being more effective than FRE.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

Greater gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy after partial range of motion training performed at long muscle lengths. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1746--1753, 2023---Whether there is an optimal range of motion (ROM) to induce muscle hypertrophy remains elusive, especially for gastrocnemius. This study aimed to compare the changes in gastrocnemius muscle thickness between calf raise exercise performed with full ROM (FULL ROM ), partial ROM performed in the initial (INITIAL ROM ), and final (FINAL ROM ) portions of the ROM. Forty-two young women performed a calf training program for 8 weeks, 3 days{$\cdot$}week -1 , with differences in the calf raise ROM configuration. The calf raise exercise was performed in a pin-loaded, horizontal, leg-press machine, in 3 sets of 15--20 repetition maximum. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: FULL ROM (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), INITIAL ROM (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}), and FINAL ROM (ankle: 0{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), where 0{$^\circ$} was defined as an angle of 90{$^\circ$} of the foot with the tibia. The muscle thickness measurements of medial and lateral gastrocnemius were taken by means of B-mode ultrasound. INITIAL ROM elicited greater medial gastrocnemius increases than FULL ROM and FINAL ROM (INITIAL ROM = +15.2\% vs. FULL ROM = +6.7\% and FINAL ROM = +3.4\%; p {$\leq$} 0.009). Furthermore, INITIAL ROM elicited greater lateral gastrocnemius increases than FINAL ROM (INITIAL ROM = +14.9\% vs. FINAL ROM = +6.2\%; p {$<$} 0.024) but did not significantly differ from FULL ROM (FULL ROM = +7.3\%; p = 0.060). The current results suggest that calf training performed at longer muscle lengths may optimize gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in young women. Therefore, when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented training, the inclusion of the calf raise exercise performed with partial ROM in the initial portion of the excursion should be considered.},

J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1135-1144, 2022-Resistance exercise range of motion (ROM) influences muscular adaptations. However, there are no consistent practical guidelines about the optimal ROM for maximizing muscle hypertrophy. The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature for studies that compared the effects of full ROM (fROM) and partial ROM (pROM) on muscle hypertrophy. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify articles from the earliest record up to and including April 2022. We calculated the effect size (ES) scores of the variables of interest. Eleven studies were included in the review. Full ROM and pROM performed in the initial part of the ROM elicited greater muscle hypertrophy of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps brachii, and brachialis distal sites (between-groups ES: 0.20-0.90) than pROM performed in the final part of the ROM. fROM elicited greater muscle growth on the gluteus maximus and adductors than pROM in the final part of the ROM (between-groups ES: 0.24-0.25). Initial pROM produced more favorable proximal rectus femoris hypertrophy than fROM (between-groups ES: 0.35-0.38). pROM in the middle part of the ROM elicited greater triceps brachii hypertrophy than fROM (between-group ES: 1.21). In conclusion, evidence suggests that when training at a longer muscle length-through either pROM or fROM-some muscles, such as quadriceps femoris, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii, tend to experience optimal growth. Thus, the use pROM in the initial part of the excursion in combination with fROM training should be considered when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented resistance training programs.},

  abstract = {Background: The triceps surae muscle plays important roles in fundamental human movements. However, this muscle is relatively unresponsive to resistance training (difficult to hypertrophy) but prone to atrophy with inactivity compared with other muscles. Thus, identifying an effective training modality for the triceps surae is warranted. This study compared triceps surae muscle hypertrophy after standing/knee-extended versus seated/knee-flexed plantarflexion (calf-raise) training, where the gastrocnemius is lengthened and shortened, respectively. Methods: Fourteen untrained adults conducted calf-raise training with one leg in a standing/knee-extended position and the other leg in a seated/knee 90{$^\circ$}-flexed position at 70\% of one-repetition maximum. Each leg performed 10 repetitions/set, 5 sets/session, 2 sessions/week for 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention, magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained to assess muscle volume of each and the whole triceps surae. Results : Muscle volume significantly increased in all three muscles and the whole triceps surae for both legs ( p {$\leq$} 0.031), except for the gastrocnemius muscles of the seated condition leg ( p = 0.147--0.508). The changes in muscle volume were significantly greater for the standing than seated condition leg in the lateral gastrocnemius (12.4\% vs. 1.7\%), medial gastrocnemius (9.2\% vs. 0.6\%), and whole triceps surae (5.6\% vs. 2.1\%) ( p {$\leq$} 0.011), but similar between legs in the soleus (2.1\% vs. 2.9\%, p = 0.410). Conclusion: Standing calf-raise was by far more effective, therefore recommended, than seated calf-raise for inducing muscle hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius and consequently the whole triceps surae. This result and similar between-condition hypertrophy in the soleus collectively suggest that training at long muscle lengths promotes muscle hypertrophy.}

Furthermore, we tried to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in angle specificity after isometric training from the aspect of neuromuscular adaptation and the changes in the properties of the muscle--tendon complex. Nine males completed 12-week unilateral training program (70\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) {\texttimes} 15{$\quad$}s {\texttimes} six sets) on the knee extensors at 50{$^\circ$} (shorter muscle length: ST) and 100{$^\circ$} (longer muscle length: LT). The internal muscle force (mechanical stress) is higher at 100{$^\circ$} than at 50{$^\circ$} because of the difference in the moment arm length, although there were no difference in the relative torque level, contraction and relaxation times, and repetition between ST and LT. Before and after training, isometric strength at eight angles and muscle volume were determined. Tendon elongation of knee extensors was measured by ultrasonography. There was no significant difference in the rate of increment of muscle volume between the protocols. Tendon stiffness increased significantly for LT, but not for ST. Although significant gain was limited to angles at or near the training angle for ST, increases in MVC at all angles were found for LT. These results suggest that only mechanical stress (internal muscle force imposed on muscle and tendon) contributes to adaptation in the tendon stiffness, although metabolic (relative torque level, etc.) and mechanical stress relate to muscle hypertrophy. Furthermore, increment of tendon stiffness for LT might contribute to increase torque output at smaller angles other than the training angle.},

This review summarizes recent insight into the mechanisms behind how titin gene mutations cause hereditary cardiomyopathy and how titin protein is mechanically active in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. A main theme is the evolving role of titin as a modulator of contraction. Topics include strain-sensing via titin in the sarcomeric A-band as the basis for length-dependent activation, titin elastic recoil and refolding of titin domains as an energy source, and Ca 2+ -dependent stiffening of titin stretched during eccentric muscle contractions. Findings suggest that titin stiffness is a principal regulator of the contractile behavior of striated muscle. Physiological or pathological changes to titin stiffness therefore affect contractility. Taken together, titin emerges as a linker element between passive and active myocyte properties.},

We compared triceps brachii hypertrophy after elbow extension training performed in the overhead vs. neutral arm position. Using a cable machine, 21 adults conducted elbow extensions (90-0{$^\circ$}) with one arm in the overhead (Overhead-Arm) and the other arm in the neutral (Neutral-Arm) position at 70\% one-repetition maximum (1RM), 10 reps/set, 5 sets/session, 2 sessions/week for 12 weeks. Training load was gradually increased (+5\% 1RM/session) when the preceding session was completed without repetition failure. 1RM of the assigned condition and MRI-measured muscle volume of the TBLong, monoarticular lateral and medial heads (TBLat+Med), and whole triceps brachii (Whole-TB) were assessed pre- and post-training. Training load and 1RM increased in both arms similarly (+62-71\% at post, P\,=\,0.285), while their absolute values/weights were always lower in Overhead-Arm (-34-39\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Changes in muscle volume in Overhead-Arm compared to Neutral-Arm were 1.5-fold greater for the TBLong (+28.5\% vs. +19.6\%, Cohen's d\,=\,0.61, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), 1.4-fold greater for the TBLat+Med (+14.6\% vs. +10.5\%, d\,=\,0.39, P\,=\,0.002), and 1.4-fold greater for the Whole-TB (+19.9\% vs. +13.9\%, d\,=\,0.54, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In conclusion, triceps brachii hypertrophy was substantially greater after elbow extension training performed in the overhead versus neutral arm position, even with lower absolute loads used during the training.HighlightsGrowing evidence suggests that resistance training at long muscle lengths promotes muscle hypertrophy, but its practical applications are yet to be explored.Triceps brachii muscle hypertrophy was substantially greater after cable elbow extension training performed in the overhead than neutral arm position, particularly in the biarticular triceps brachii long head, even with lower absolute loads lifted (i.e. lower mechanical stress to muscles/joints).Cable elbow extension training should be performed in the overhead rather than neutral arm position if one aims to maximise muscle hypertrophy of the triceps brachii or to prevent atrophy of this muscle.},

  abstract = {Hamstring strain injuries during sprinting or stretching frequently occur at long-muscle length. Yet, previous research has mainly focused on studying the effectiveness of eccentric hamstring strengthening at shorter muscle length on hamstring performance, morphology, and hamstring strain injury risk factors. Here, we evaluated the effects of 6-week eccentric hamstring training at long-muscle length on functional and architectural characteristics of the hamstrings. Healthy and injury-free participants (n = 40; age 23.7 {\textpm} 2.5 years) were randomly assigned to control or intervention group. Training intervention consisted of 12 sessions with two eccentric hamstring exercises in a lengthened position. Outcome measures included isokinetic and isometric knee flexion peak torque, Nordic hamstring exercise peak torque, voluntary activation level, and countermovement jump performance. Ultrasonography was used to determine muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length of biceps femoris long head (BFlh). A significant time {\texttimes} group interaction effect was observed for all measured parameters except countermovement jump performance and muscle thickness. The training intervention resulted in increased concentric and eccentric knee flexion peak torque at 60{$^\circ$}/s ( d  = 0.55-0.62, P  = .02 and .03) and concentric peak torque at 180{$^\circ$}/s ( d  = 0.99, P  = .001), increased isometric knee flexion peak torque ( d  = 0.73, P  = .008) and Nordic hamstring exercise peak torque ( d  = 1.19, P  {$<$} .001), increased voluntary activation level ( d  = 1.29, P  {$<$} .001), decreased pennation angle ( d  = 1.31, P  {$<$} .001), and increased fascicle length ( d  = 1.12, P  {$<$} .001) of BFlh. These results provide evidence that short-term eccentric hamstring strengthening at long-muscle length can have significant favorable effects on various architectural and functional characteristics of the hamstrings.},

Controls (CON; n 5 10) were untrained. Quadriceps strength, vastus lateralis architecture, anatomical cross-sectional area (aCSA), and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured at weeks 0, 8, 10, and 12. Results: Increases in fascicle length (29 6 4\% vs. 14 6 4\%), distal aCSA (53 6 12\% vs. 18 6 8\%), strength (26 6 6\% vs. 7 6 3\%), and IGF-1 (31 6 6\% vs. 7 6 6\%) were greater in LL compared with SL muscles (P {$<$} 0.05). No changes occurred in CON. Detraining decrements in strength and aCSA were greater in SL than LL muscles (P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: Enhanced muscle in vivo (and somewhat IGF-1) adaptations to resistance training are concurrent with muscle stretch, which warrants its inclusion within training.},

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

Determining changes in muscle size and architecture after exercise training: One site does not fit all. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 787--790, 2024---Different methods can be used to assess muscle hypertrophy, but the effects of training on regional changes in muscle size can be detected only using direct muscle measurements such as muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, or volume. Importantly, muscle size increases vary across regions within and between muscles after resistance training programs (i.e., heterogeneous, or nonuniform, muscle hypertrophy). Muscle architectural changes, including fascicle length and pennation angle, after resistance and stretch training programs are also region-specific. In this paper, we show that the literature indicates that a single-site measure of muscle shape does not properly capture the effects achieved after exercise training interventions and that conclusions concerning the magnitude of muscle adaptations can vary substantially depending on the muscle site to be examined. Thus, we propose that measurements of muscle size and architecture should be completed at multiple sites across regions between the agonist muscles within a muscle group and along the length of the muscles to provide an adequate picture of training effects.},

  abstract = {Muscular strength and hypertrophy following resistance training may be obtained in different degrees depending on the approach performed. This study was designed to compare the responses of the biceps brachii to two preacher curl exercises, one performed on a cable-pulley system (CAB; in which a greater torque was applied during the exercise when elbows were flexed and biceps shortened) and one performed with a barbell (BAR; in which greater torque was applied when the elbows were extended and biceps stretched). Thirty-five young adults (CAB: 13 men, 5 women; BAR: 12 men, 5 women; age = 24 {\textpm} 5 years) performed a resistance training program three times per week for 10 weeks, with preacher curl exercises performed in three sets of 8-12 repetitions. Outcomes measured included elbow flexion peak isokinetic torque at angles of 20{$^\circ$}, 60{$^\circ$}, and 100{$^\circ$} (considering 0{$^\circ$} as elbow extended), and biceps brachii thickness (B-mode ultrasound). Following the training period, there were significant increases for both groups in elbow flexion peak torque at the 20{$^\circ$} (CAB: 30\%; BAR = 39\%; p = 0.046), 60{$^\circ$} (CAB: 27\%; BAR = 32\%; p = 0.874), and 100{$^\circ$} (CAB: 17\%; BAR = 19\%; p = 0.728), and biceps brachii thickness (CAB: 7\%; BAR = 8\%; p = 0.346). In conclusion, gains in muscular strength were greater for BAR only at longer muscle length, whereas hypertrophy was similar regardless of whether torque emphasis was carried out in the final (CAB) or initial (BAR) degrees of the range of motion of the preacher curl in young adults.},

  abstract = {Isometric training is used in the rehabilitation and physical preparation of athletes, special populations, and the general public. However, little consensus exists regarding training guidelines for a variety of desired outcomes. Understanding the adaptive response to specific loading parameters would be of benefit to practitioners. The objective of this systematic review, therefore, was to detail the medium- to long-term adaptations of different types of isometric training on morphological, neurological, and performance variables. Exploration of the relevant subject matter was performed through MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases. English, full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles and unpublished doctoral dissertations investigating medium- to long-term ({$\geq$}3 weeks) adaptations to isometric training in humans were identified. These studies were evaluated further for methodological quality. Twenty-six research outputs were reviewed. Isometric training at longer muscle lengths (0.86\%-1.69\%/week, ES = 0.03-0.09/week) produced greater muscular hypertrophy when compared to equal volumes of shorter muscle length training (0.08\%-0.83\%/week, ES = -0.003 to 0.07/week). Ballistic intent resulted in greater neuromuscular activation (1.04\%-10.5\%/week, ES = 0.02-0.31/week vs 1.64\%-5.53\%/week, ES = 0.03-0.20/week) and rapid force production (1.2\%-13.4\%/week, ES = 0.05-0.61/week vs 1.01\%-8.13\%/week, ES = 0.06-0.22/week). Substantial improvements in muscular hypertrophy and maximal force production were reported regardless of training intensity. High-intensity ({$\geq$}70\%) contractions are required for improving tendon structure and function. Additionally, long muscle length training results in greater transference to dynamic performance. Despite relatively few studies meeting the inclusion criteria, this review provides practitioners with insight into which isometric training variables (eg, joint angle, intensity, intent) to manipulate to achieve desired morphological and neuromuscular adaptations.},

Results showed that the INITIALROM group presented a greater relative increase than all groups at 70\%, and at 50\% and 60\% the increases were greater than FINALROM, FULLROM, and non-training control (CON) groups. Moreover, FINALROM group presented similar changes compared to the CON group at 60\% and 70\%. In regard to 1RM, FINALROM and INITIALROM groups presented greater relative increases at the ROM trained, and no group showed greater increases than VARROM or INITIALROM, regardless the ROM tested.

Thus, we compared the changes in strength and regional muscle hypertrophy after training in protocols with different ranges of motion (ROM) in the seated dumbbell preacher curl exercise using a within-participant experimental design. Design and methods: Nineteen young women had one arm randomly assigned to train in the initial ROM (INITIALROM: 0{\textopenbullet}--68{\textopenbullet}; 0{\textopenbullet} = extended elbow) while the contralateral arm trained in the final ROM (FINALROM: 68{\textopenbullet}--135{\textopenbullet}), three times per week over an eight-week study period. Pre- and posttraining assessments included one repetition maximum (1RM) testing in the full ROM (0{\textopenbullet}--135{\textopenbullet}), and measurement of biceps brachii cross-sectional area (CSA) at 50\% and 70\% of humerus length. Paired t-tests were used to compare regional CSA changes between groups, the sum of CSA changes at 50\% and 70\% (CSAsummed), and the strength response between the training protocols. Results: The INITIALROM protocol displayed a greater CSA increase than FINALROM protocol at 70\% of biceps length (p = 0.001). Alternatively, we observed similar increases between the protocols for CSA at 50\% (p = 0.311) and for CSAsummed (p = 0.111). Moreover, the INITIALROM protocol displayed a greater 1RM increase than FINALROM (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that training in the initial angles of elbow flexion exercise promotes greater distal hypertrophy of the biceps brachii muscle in untrained young women. Moreover, the INITIALROM condition promotes a greater dynamic strength increase when tested at a full ROM compared to the FINALROM.},

  abstract = {Current debate exists around whether a presumed eccentric exercise, the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), actually causes active hamstring muscle lengthening. This is because of the decoupling that can occur between the muscle fascicle and muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length changes in relatively compliant human lower-limb MTUs, which results in MTU lengthening not necessarily causing muscle fascicle lengthening. This missing knowledge complicates the interpretation of why the NHE is effective at reducing running-related hamstring muscle injury risk in athletes previously unfamiliar with performing this exercise. The purpose of the study was therefore to investigate if the most-commonly injured hamstring muscle, the biceps femoris long head (BF), exhibits active muscle lengthening (i.e. an eccentric muscle action) during the NHE up until peak force in Nordic novices. External reaction force at the ankle, knee flexion angle, and BF and semitendinosus muscle activities were recorded from the left leg of 14 participants during the NHE. Simultaneously, BF muscle architecture was imaged using B-mode ultrasound imaging, and muscle architecture changes were tracked using two different tracking algorithms. From {\textasciitilde}85 to 100\% of peak NHE force, both tracking algorithms detected that BF muscle fascicles ( n = 10) significantly lengthened ( p \&lt; 0.01) and had a mean positive lengthening velocity ( p {$\leq$} 0.02), while knee extension velocity remained positive (17{$^\circ\cdot$}s -1 ) over knee flexion angles from 53 to 37{$^\circ$} and a duration of 1.6 s. Despite some individual cases of brief isometric fascicle behavior and brief fascicle shortening during BF MTU lengthening, the predominant muscle action was eccentric under a relatively high muscle activity level (59\% of maximum). Eccentric hamstring muscle action therefore does occur during the NHE in relatively strong (429 N) Nordic novices, which might contribute to the increase in resting BF muscle fascicle length and reduction in running-related injury risk, which have previously been reported following NHE training. Whether an eccentric BF muscle action occurs in individuals accustomed to the NHE remains to be tested.}

As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

Focusing on coaches of the more muscular divisions in the National Physique Committee/IFBB Professional League federations (men's classic physique, men's bodybuilding, women's physique, women's bodybuilding) for both natural and enhanced athletes, coaches were recruited via word of mouth and social media, and 33 responded to an anonymous online survey. Survey responses indicated that participant coaches recommend three-to-seven meals per day and no less than 2 g/kg/day of protein regardless of sex, division, or PED usage. During contest preparation, participant coaches alter a natural competitor's protein intake by -25\% to +10\% and an enhanced competitor's protein intake by 0\% to +25\%. Regarding cardiovascular exercise protocols, approximately two-thirds of participant coaches recommend fasted cardiovascular exercise, with the common rationale of combining the exercise with thermogenic supplements while considering the athlete's preference. Low- and moderate-intensity steady state were the most commonly recommended types of cardiovascular exercise among participant coaches; high-intensity interval training was the least popular. Creatine was ranked in the top two supplements for all surveyed categories. Regarding PEDs, testosterone, growth hormone, and methenolone were consistently ranked in the top five recommended PEDs by participant coaches. The results of this study provide insight into common themes in the decisions made by bodybuilding coaches, and highlight areas in which more research is needed to empirically support those decisions.},

Maximal voluntary contraction torque of isometric (MVC-ISO), concentric (MVC-CON), and eccentric contractions (MVC-ECC), and thickness (MT) of biceps brachii and brachialis of the trained and non-trained arms were assessed at baseline and 4--8 days after the last training session. The control group did not show significant changes in any variables. Significant (P {$<$} 0.05) increases in MVCISO torque (16.2 {\textpm} 12.6\%), MVC-CON torque (21.1 {\textpm} 24.4\%), and MVC-ECC torque (19.6 {\textpm} 17.5\%) of the trained arm were observed for the EXT group only.

Hypertrophy is a desired outcome in many sports. For some athletes, muscular bulk and, conceivably, the accompanying increase in strength/power, are desirable attributes for optimal performance. Moreover, bodybuilders and other physique athletes are judged in part on their muscular size, with placings predicated on the overall magnitude of lean mass. In some cases, even relatively small improvements in hypertrophy might be the difference between winning and losing in competition for these athletes. This position stand of leading experts in the field synthesizes the current body of research to provide guidelines for maximizing skeletal muscle hypertrophy in an athletic population. The recommendations represent a consensus of a consortium of experts in the field, based on the best available current evidence. Specific sections of the paper are devoted to elucidating the constructs of hypertrophy, reconciliation of acute vs long-term evidence, and the relationship between strength and hypertrophy to provide context to our recommendations.}

  abstract = {Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale -- whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry -- whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.},

Muscle thickness at 50\% length was increased 10.7 {\textpm} 15.3\% (p {$<$} 0.05) and 13.7 {\textpm} 9.0\% (p {$<$} 0.01) after S and L, while at 60\% it was increased 15.5 {\textpm} 18.8\% (p {$<$} 0.05) and 19.4 {\textpm} 16.3\% (p {$<$} 0.01), respectively. Longitudinal muscle area increased similarly after S and L (p {$<$} 0.01). Fascicle angle and length were not altered with training. These results indicate that muscle strength and architecture of elbow extensors adapt similarly during the first six weeks of resistance training at either long or short fascicle length.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has become commonplace within sport and exercise science for synthesising and summarising empirical studies. However, most research in the field focuses upon mean effects, particularly the effects of interventions to improve outcomes such as fitness or performance. It is thought that individual responses to interventions vary considerably. Hence, interest has increased in exploring precision or personalised exercise approaches. Not only is the mean often affected by interventions, but variation may also be impacted. Exploration of variation in studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can yield insight into interindividual heterogeneity in response to interventions and help determine generalisability of effects. Yet, larger samples sizes than those used for typical mean effects are required when probing variation. Thus, in a field with small samples such as sport and exercise science, exploration of variation through a meta-analytic framework is appealing. Despite the value of embracing and exploring variation alongside mean effects in sport and exercise science, it is rarely applied to research synthesis through meta-analysis. We introduce and evaluate different effect size calculations along with models for meta-analysis of variation using relatable examples from resistance training RCTs.},

  abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 15-week partial range of motion (ROM) resistance training program on the vastus lateralis (VL) architecture and mechanical properties, when the time under tension (TUT) was equalized. Methods{\enspace} Nineteen untrained male subjects were randomly assigned to a control (Control; n\,=\,8) or training (TG; n\,=\,11) group. In the TG, the dominant and nondominant legs were randomly selected to be trained with a full ROM (FULL) or a partial ROM (PART) in an isokinetic dynamometer. Training volume was equalized based on the TUT by manipulating sets and repetitions. The VL muscle architecture was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography at rest and during maximal isometric knee extension contractions (MVCs) at ten knee angles. The VL fascicle force and specific tension were calculated from the MVCs with superimposed stimuli, accounting for the moment arm length, muscle architecture, and antagonist coactivation. Results{\enspace} The FULL training induced changes in fascicle length (FL) (4.9\,{\textpm}\,2.0\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and specific tension (25.8\,{\textpm}\,18.7\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was a moderate effect of PART training on the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) (7.8\,{\textpm}\,4.0\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, dav = 0.6) and torque--angle adaptations (average increase 17.7\,{\textpm}\,3.9\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions{\enspace} These results provide evidence that crucial architectural and mechanical muscle adaptations are dependent on the ROM used in strength training. It seems that muscle FL and specific tension can be increased by pure concentric training if greater ROM is used. Conversely, restricting the ROM to shorter muscle lengths promotes a greater PCSA and angle-specific strength adaptations.},

  abstract = {Summary The purpose of this study was to examine whether inter- and intramuscular differences in hypertrophy induced by resistance training correspond to differences in muscle activation during the first training session. Eleven young men completed 12 weeks of training intervention for knee extension. Before and after the intervention, T1-weighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) images were recorded to determine the volume and anatomical cross-sectional area ( CSA ) along the length of the individual muscles of the quadriceps femoris. The T2-weighted MR images were also acquired before and immediately after the first training session. The T2 was calculated for each pixel within the quadriceps femoris, from which the muscle activation was evaluated as \%activated volume and area. The results showed that the \%activated volume after the first training session was significantly higher in the vastus intermedius than the vastus medialis. However, the relative change in muscle volume after the training intervention was significantly greater in the rectus femoris than the vasti muscles (vastus lateralis, intermedius and medialis). Within the rectus femoris, both the \%activated area and relative increase in CSA  were significantly greater in the distal region than the proximal region. In contrast, the \%activated area and relative increase in CSA of the vasti were nearly uniform along each muscle. These results suggest that the muscle activation during the first training session is associated with the intramuscular difference in hypertrophy induced by training intervention, but not with the intermuscular difference.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background: Range of motion (ROM) during resistance training is of growing interest and is potentially used to elicit differing adaptations (e.g. muscle hypertrophy and muscular strength and power). To date, attempts at synthesising the data on ROM during resistance training have primarily focused on muscle hypertrophy in the lower body. Objective: Our aim was to meta-analyse and systematically review the effects of ROM on a variety of outcomes including hypertrophy, strength, sport, power and body-fat type outcomes. Following pre-registration and consistent with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of PubMed and SportsDISCUS was performed. Data was extracted and a Bayesian multi-level meta-analysis was performed. A range of exploratory sub-group and moderator analyses were performed. Results: The main model revealed a trivial SMD (0.12; 95\% CI: --0.02, 0.26) in favour of full ROM compared to partial ROM. When grouped by outcome, SMDs all favoured full ROM, but SMDs were trivial to small (all between 0.05 to 0.2). Sub-group analyses suggested there may be a muscle hypertrophy benefit to partial ROM training at long muscle lengths compared to using a full ROM (--0.28; 95\% CI: --0.81, 0.16). Analysis also suggested the existence of a specificity aspect to ROM, such that training in the ROM being tested as an outcome resulted in greater strength adaptations. No clear differences were found between upper- and lower-body adaptations when ROM was manipulated. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that using a full or long ROM may enhance results for most outcomes (strength, speed, power, muscle size, and body composition). Differences in adaptations are trivial to small. As such, partial ROM resistance training might present an efficacious alternative for variation and personal preference, or where injury prevents full-ROM resistance training.}

Thirty-eight healthy women completed a 9-week resistance training program consisting of either 4 sets of 12 repetitions to volitional failure of inclined bicep curls (INC group) or preacher curls (PREA group), three times per week. Pre- and post-intervention muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound imaging with a linear-array transducer. Scan acquisition sites were determined by measuring 50\%, 60\% and 70\% of the distance between the posterior crest of the acromion and the olecranon. Statistical significance was set at p {$<$} 0.05. No region of the INC group grew when comparing pre- to post-intervention. The 70\% region of the PREA group grew significantly (muscle thickness increased from 2.7  0.43 cm to 2.94  0.44 cm). We found no growth differences between regions when analysing per group (p = 0.274), region (p = 0.571) or group*region (p = 0.367). Our results show that the distal region of the arm grows in response to the preacher curl that places the highest amount of strain in the range of motion in which the arm muscles are more elongated.},
